# VitePress Template with Pages CMS Integration

This project is a ready-to-use VitePress template designed for rapid documentation and content sites. It comes preconfigured with a `.pages.yml` file for seamless integration with [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org).

## Features

- **VitePress**: Fast, modern static site generator powered by Vite and Vue.
- **Pages CMS**: Edit your content and configuration visually via the Pages CMS interface, using the `.pages.yml` file for structure and settings.
- **Preconfigured Setup**: No need for manual configuration—just clone, deploy, and start editing your docs or site content.
- **CMS-Friendly**: All key content and settings are managed in editable files (Markdown and YAML), making it easy to update via the CMS or directly in your repo.

## How It Works

1. **Edit Content**: Write your documentation or site pages in Markdown under the `docs/` directory.
2. **Manage Structure**: The `.pages.yml` file defines navigation, order, and other site settings, all editable via Pages CMS.
3. **Visual Editing**: Use [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) to edit your site visually—no coding required for most changes.
4. **Deploy Anywhere**: Host your site on any static hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
